Donald J. Trump Truth Social Post 04:50 PM EST 10/10/25 

It has just been learned that China has taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the World, stating that they were going to, effective November 1st, 2025, impose large scale Export Controls on virtually every product they make, and some not even made by them. This affects ALL Countries, without exception, and was obviously a plan devised by them years ago. It is absolutely unheard of in International Trade, and a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations.

Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position, and speaking only for the U.S.A., and not other Nations who were similarly threatened, starting November 1st, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying. Also on November 1st, we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software.

It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

In a Truth Social post, Trump said the idea is “subject to SEC approval” and would “save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.”

“Did you ever hear the statement that, ‘China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis??? Not good!!!’” Trump said.

The wisdom of quarterly reports has come under question before. In a 2018 op-ed piece for The Wall Street Journal, Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon advocated doing away with quarterly guidance, though not earnings reports.

“In our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability,” the pair wrote.

Current regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed either from the Securities and Exchange Commission or could be altered by Congress.

Supporters of the current system say it provides investors with timely opportunity as well as transparency about public companies.

The most obvious indicator is that during the dot com bubble gold was at it's lowest in decades. Money was too excited to be in anywhere other than internet stocks.

Right now gold is all-time high and still climbing quickly.

So how do we explain a market that seems to go up every day centered around a few dominant industries? Where some stocks maintain mind boggling valuations while everyone is calling bubble?

**Right now the rich are more scared of cash then a crash**

This is due to a combination of USD devaluation through policy (and global macro trends), sticky inflation due to the fed's hands being tied by immense national debt, and a chaotic administration.

Basically whether intentionally or not, the value of the USD from both sides (inflation + devluation) has collapsed. This is favourable for reducing national debt but means that cash is poison to hold.

The result is no one with significant capital (retail, companies, and governments) wants to be invested in the market at these valuations, but staying in cash is a guaranteed loss.

In scenarios like this, you either choose real assets (Like gold or bitcoin - not traditionally real but equally scarce) or equities that seem poised for growth (AI).

If you take a look at the SP500 outside of AI, you realize that growth is not very significant. Non-growing equities don't perform well because if their earnings don't grow significantly, they also suffer from currency devaluation.

**No one wants to be anywhere other than US equities.**

For the past few years the Chinese economy has slowed, the European economy mediocre, the Japanese economy stagnant, and the Russian economy in shatters.

Essentially when investors are forced to be in equities, they will always choose American first. People may not trust the USD or the government itself, but they do trust good old American capitalism and tech superiority.

I’m aware global equities have performed well in comparison with the US economy in 2025 but what about the past 5 years or Mag7? 

And yes at this point in the cycle there is some capital flight away from US due to the valuations but if America ever dips it’ll come right back.

**In other words, this bull market, and especially the AI industry is so resilient because it's propped up by multiple reasons**

It’s not solely AI being hyped over the moon or OpenAI entangling itself with the entire tech industry.

That alone does not create the market we’re in.

We are in a triple bull market.

Now don't ask me when the music will stop. I don't know.

Although as long as US equities remain the best companies on the planet, cash continues to feel unsafe, ai keeps sparking wild expectations about the future, and global economies (not just looking at 2025 performance) remain relatively weak, I would not be surprised if a significant crash is unlikely.

Conversely if any of this starts to change, it may be worth watching.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o1ioby/we_arent_in_the_dot_com_bubble_were_in_an/,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o1ioby/we_arent_in_the_dot_com_bubble_were_in_an/,earnings;fed;inflation

Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position, and speaking only for the U.S.A., and not other Nations who were similarly threatened, starting November 1st, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying. Also on November 1st, we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software.

It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

I maxed it out between 2017-2021. I think in 2019 I had around 90-100k. In 2022 I went back to just the company match cause I had another kid (that would have been the best time to max), then maxed it out again in 2023.

* Oracle announces $455B in RPOs through 2030, driving stock up 40% in a single day
* $300B of this (66%) depends on a single contract with OpenAI starting in 2027
* OpenAI's funding for this contract comes from SoftBank's $500B Stargate commitment
* SoftBank's total assets are $300B - meaning they'd need to liquidate their entire company just for the Oracle deal
* This is the same SoftBank that valued WeWork at $47B then watched it collapse, promised $108B for Vision Fund 2 but only raised $56B, and has a 30+ year track record of overpromising and underdelivering
* SoftBank funding is contingent on OpenAI converting from a nonprofit to a for-profit, which California AG is investigating and could require a $30B+ payment
* Even if all this works out, Oracle's RPO delivery doesn't start until 2027 - giving 2+ years for this house of cards to collapse
* Oracle's current market cap surge assumes a company with $168B in assets and under $15B in Q1 2025 revenue will somehow deploy $800B+ across multiple AI infrastructure commitments

So Oracle's stock price is essentially a 3x leveraged bet on SoftBank's ability to fund commitments that exceed their entire balance sheet, while navigating regulatory hurdles, legal challenges, and their own history of spectacular failures?

The labor market is still holding up. Sure, unemployment has ticked up a little, but it’s nowhere near a collapse. Powell has already said they’ll tolerate some labor pain before even thinking about easing. If you’re waiting for the Fed to rescue every weak jobs print, you’re not paying attention.

Inflation is still too high. Core PCE is hovering above 2.5 percent and closer to 2.7 or 2.8. That’s not a victory lap. That’s exactly the range where Powell has said he doesn’t have “confidence” inflation is under control. Cutting now would risk reigniting it and blowing up the last two years of progress.

Powell is not a dove. Every time markets get ahead of themselves, he slaps them down. Jackson Hole is coming up, and if history tells us anything, he’ll remind everyone that the Fed is data dependent, not market dependent. Translation: he doesn’t care about your bets.

Credibility is everything right now. Cutting while inflation is still running hot and the jobs market is still functioning would make the Fed look weak. They’d rather be accused of holding too long than cutting too early and losing control.

History backs this up. The Fed doesn’t pivot on one or two soft jobs reports. Policy lags mean hikes are still filtering through. They know it. That’s why they’ll hold.

Bottom line: There’s no cut in September. Unless we suddenly get a jobs collapse and inflation magically melts away, the Fed is staying put.

You see, a successful business is not determined by how advanced the technology is, but by its ability to generate a pile of money. Business, first of all, is a cash generator. And we, as investors, want to own great cash generators. The problem with quantum stocks is that none of them are great businesses (aside from maybe IBM and Google, which aren't really ""quantum stocks"").

Let's put aside the complexity of quantum computing and how difficult it is to scale. Let's assume we've solved all technical issues. Do you know how much it costs to build and maintain a quantum solution? Do you know how much it would cost to develop commercialized mass-manufacturing? To educate the personnel? The answer: a freaking unimaginable amount.
  
There's no company in Taiwan that will print you quantum chips on demand. There aren't millions of quantum engineers and software programmers waiting to be employed. The infrastructure does not exist. Quantum technology won't be scalable for decades - maybe half a century.
  
You can't even compare quantum to the AI revolution. AI is still silicon-based and can reuse existing infrastructure. Quantum technology reimagines our entire approach to computing from scratch. And it costs a hell of a lot of money (tons of debt, none of profit).

None of the companies on the market will dominate the quantum space. They're not businesses - they're research labs (and some are scams). The companies that will eventually build infrastructure, hire engineers, and scale to the market don't exist yet.

Technology doesn't mean business. Research doesn't mean cash. And sadly, even established companies with fully built infrastructure and strong brands can fail as businesses (sorry, Intel, I'm talking about you).

See how absurd it is that current quantum stocks already have billions in market cap, sitting alongside successful businesses? These companies print flashy news releases and talk big about how quantum will change everything. They exploit public ignorance about technology to sell wet dreams stuffed with money bags. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Your money will soon end up in the pockets of insiders and hedge funds.

This is a reality check not just for quantum stocks, but for tech hype in general. Think twice where you put your money. Maybe it's better to take your profit, consider yourself lucky, and buy your girlfriend flowers or a house?

Not investment advice, of course, but I'd rather put a smile on a girl's face than invest in quantum. ;)

P.S.
When in doubt, trust fundamentals, not your biases. Don't fool yourself into thinking you would've picked Nvidia in 2015 if you only had the information available in 2015. Today is the same - you don't know who's going to be the champ in 2035. It will surprise us all.

Then he gets to name a chairman next year, that gives him 3. And he's already got 2 votes (his previous nominees who voted to lower rates at the last meeting). There are only 7 votes total. Looks like he could easily end up with 4 or 5 toadies by the middle of next year. This would mean a much more dovish approach to rates.

I cannot post the chart (I'll try to put it in the comments), but since Inauguration, the SPY is up 12%, and that is what the president talks about and CNBC gets a hard-on for, BUT the dollar index is down 8% which mitigates most of the gains, barely keeping up with inflation. On the other hand, European stocks and the Euro seem to be the winners. 

Isn't this corroboration that workers with a paycheck got an 8% pay cut since Jan? Maybe that's a bit overstated, but it feels that way. Add to this, longer term interest rates have actually RISEN since the latest 0.25% Fed funds rate cut.  Granted, they had come down in the weeks before in anticipation, but this seems odd.

Most of the content is buried in here: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1814215/000095017025112269/buru-20250829.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1814215/000095017025112269/buru-20250829.htm)

**Nuburu pre-2025**

So Nuburu *was* a real company, probably. They made “blue lasers” and an “extreme-brightness AI™ laser”. By 2024 they ran out of cash, the founder quit, and they stopped filing quarterly reports. The debt holders took their patents as collateral. They stopped paying their workers who quit. By 2025 the company is just a financial shell. (page 33)

**Alessandro Zamboni is a Serial Diluter**

In 2025 Nuburu somehow got taken over by this guy:

Alessandro’s last company was Supply@Me Capital

Supply@Me deploys state of the art technologies like AI, IoT, Blockchain and cloud to create a new asset class, monetized inventory which leverages

SYME issued 72B shares and stopped filing in 2023. 

**Alessandro dilutes Nuburu Shareholders Round 1**

Alessandro becomes CEO of Nuburu in 2025 (somehow) and immediately dilutes the stock:

https://preview.redd.it/yk6wayiw8vsf1.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b977a094fb1a753ca03710b2c9166f5f6810311

From the filing, that dilution raised $5.14M. Then Nuburu makes a $5.15M investment into SYME. Money gets sucked out of Nuburu and into a company Alessandro controls. (page F-35)

**Dilution Round 2, Italian Edition**

Nuburu reverse splits and raises $12M more from the public. Naturally, he’s going to dilute the company again. This time the scheme is to acquire an Italian defense company.

Suspiciously, it’s not Nuburu that’s going to acquire the Italian company, it’s a special purpose shell company called TCEI S.a.r.l. It contains a random software company called Orbit that Alessandro owned. Nuburu pays Alessandro $1.35M to put Orbit into the shell company. Then Nuburu writes a $25M IOU to buy 20% of the shell company. Btw, it’s never mentioned who owns the other 80%, but it’s possible Alessandro controls it. (page 37)

Nuburu doesn’t have $25M, but it states right in the filings that the plan is to dilute shareholders to raise that money, by issuing shares and convertible notes. I also want to point out that since Orbit is in the shell company, there is a direct path to funnel money to Alessandro. Nuburu -> shell company -> Orbit -> Alessando. 

Anyways, what we know for certain is that shareholders are going to be diluted to acquire 20% of a shell company that has a random SaSS the CEO owns. That shell company has concepts of a plan to acquire a random Italian defense company. Notice the weasel words:

“today announced it has signed an agreement with a key strategic partner to establish a framework for evaluating a controlling interest acquisition…”

An agreement to establish a framework for evaluating an acquisition. Compelling.

It’s all very confusing and hard to follow, and that’s the point. Spin the shells and make a distraction while the money slips under the table.

**Conclusion**

Alessandro diluted shareholders in his last company. He already diluted $BURU shareholders once this year and sent the money to his own company. Now he's shuffling money out of Nuburu and into opaque shell companies. Don’t give this guy any more money please.

Okay, so here’s where Nuburu (BURU) really stands as of late 2025. This isn’t fluff — I pulled from their press releases, filings, and media. I’ll try to keep it readable.

⸻

Background Recap: Why They’re Pivoting

	•	Nuburu was originally a blue-laser company: industrial / welding / precision material processing.

	•	The problem: very limited revenue, niche adoption, and the tech, by itself, wasn’t enough to move the needle.

	•	So in 2025 management decided to reposition the entire company toward defense, security, resilience, and electronic warfare.

	•	The idea: combine their laser IP (their edge) with defense systems, SaaS resilience, etc., to become a systems / platform player.

⸻

What They’ve Already Done (Facts & Moves)

Tekne Acquisition — Phased & Underway

	•	In August 2025, Nuburu (via its defense arm) acquired a 3% equity stake in Tekne S.p.A. — that’s the maximum non-controlling stake allowed under current Italian Golden Power rules.  ￼
	•	With that, they established a U.S.-based 80/20 joint venture (80% Nuburu / 20% Tekne). That JV is supposed to be immediately operational.  ￼
	•	The JV’s mandate:

	1.	Deliver ~$7.5M backlog of Tekne’s special vehicle contracts outside Italy.  ￼
	2.	Manufacture, assemble, and market Tekne’s proven product lines for the Americas.  ￼
	3.	Develop new defense-tech by combining Tekne’s licenses with Nuburu’s blue-laser platform (i.e. co-develop IP).  ￼
	•	As part of their binding agreement with Tekne shareholders, Nuburu committed to finance up to €40 million of Tekne’s working capital needs over the next 12 months.  ￼
	•	The acquisition plan is explicitly phased:
	•	Phase 1: minority investment (already done) outside Golden Power perimeter.  ￼
	•	Phase 2: U.S. joint venture (80/20) — to get operations, revenue, and integration momentum.  ￼
	•	Phase 3: full controlling acquisition (target ~70% control) in Q4 2025, pending regulatory (Italian Golden Power) and shareholder approvals.  ￼
	•	Nuburu explicitly says that media rumors that the Tekne deal is blocked are incorrect — the plan remains to move forward under a phased approach in cooperation with Italian authorities.  ￼
	•	The Italian government, under Golden Power rules, gave feedback but did not flatly block the acquisition. The approach is to comply, phase, and gradually gain control.  ￼
	•	They also note that Tekne has ~€67.4M in orders already committed via Italian Ministry of Defense, which underscores Tekne’s strategic value.  ￼
	•	In the Quarter update, they mention that during the action plan (signed August 27, 2025), Nuburu helped Tekne deliver an $6.6 million contract to a Bangladesh government agency.  ￼
	•	They are also working strategic agreements to position Nuburu Defense & Tekne as a global defense-tech hub for non-Italian clients, including NATO countries, which bolsters the logic for further “Golden Power” filings.  ￼

⸻

Capital & Financing Moves

	•	Nuburu completed a public offering in September 2025, raising $12 million gross.  ￼
	•	That raise involved issuing 32,373,536 common shares and 51,660,075 pre-funded warrants at ~$0.1428 / ~$0.1427. Also issued 126,050,417 common warrants (exercise price ~$0.1714) that expire in 5 years.  ￼
	•	The net proceeds are explicitly allocated to support their phased acquisition strategy (Tekne, JS JV, etc.), working capital, and growth initiatives in defense/operational resilience.  ￼
	•	They state their current cash position is about $6 million USD (post-offering).  ￼
	•	In their quarterly update, they say they don’t plan to issue additional shares in connection with their Silverback Capital settlement (i.e. 3(a)(10) program).  ￼

⸻

Business Structuring, Governance, & Revenue Plans

	•	They formed Nuburu Defense LLC as the hub for defense / security operations.  ￼
	•	They’re evaluating opening an operating office in Virginia, presumably to be closer to U.S. defense markets.  ￼
	•	They’ve hired a new financial controller, starting October 1, 2025, to oversee finance, planning, control, acquisition accounting.  ￼
	•	They’ve brought in a specialist to build a revenue office at the group level, to support the new subsidiaries / acquisitions.  ￼
	•	They have a strategic agreement (signed Sept 23, 2025) with an unnamed partner to evaluate acquiring a controlling interest in that partner, to accelerate development of defense / blue-laser applications. This would help with R&D, access to production, client base, etc. The plan is to negotiate / possibly close that in Q4 2025, subject to due diligence.  ￼
	•	They expect billings of ~$500,000 in Q4 2025 from the Nuburu Defense side (this is seen as the “foundation” level revenue for their pivot. Not huge, but symbolic).  ￼
	•	The electronic warfare market is cited as a target addressable market of $19.4 billion by 2028.  ￼
	•	Tekne’s existing order portfolio is said to be valued at ~US$500 million, with ~152 orders across different segments.  ￼
	•	Their SaaS / operational resilience play (Orbit S.r.l.) is part of their plan, with an aim to finalize binding agreement by October 31, 2025. Orbit is supposed to complement the defense arm with software, modules, etc.  ￼

⸻

What’s Still Pending / Risk Points (As of Now)

	•	The full 67% additional stake in Tekne (to get to ~70% control) is not yet acquired. It’s targeted for Q4 2025, but subject to Italian Golden Power regulatory clearance and shareholder approvals.  ￼
	•	“Golden Power” regulations in Italy are a huge wild card. Even though the government didn’t block it, they gave feedback and retain oversight, so that could delay or block phases.  ￼
	•	Integration / execution risk: combining Tekne, joint venture, new acquisitions, governance layers — that’s a lot of moving parts.
	•	Dilution risk: even though they are trying to limit share issuance, the $12M offering is significant, and further capital may be needed if acquisitions strain cash.
	•	Market / competitive risk: defense / electronic warfare is a tough, crowded, heavily regulated space with big incumbents.
	•	Timing risk: if any of these phases slip past Q4 2025, the credibility of the pivot could be questioned.

⸻

TL;DR: Where They Stand Now + What I Think

BURU is aggressively trying to reinvent itself from a niche blue-laser supplier into a defense / systems / platform company. They’ve already bought a 3% stake in Tekne, launched a U.S. JV (with real contracts, $7.5M backlog), committed capital, and set up governance changes. The plan is to push through full control by Q4 2025, assuming regulators cooperate. Meanwhile, they raised $12M to fund all this, hired controllers, opened the defense unit, and started delivering on contracts (e.g. Tekne + Bangladesh contract).

If everything works — Tekne deal closes, Orbit acquisition goes through, the JV scales, and they book real defense contracts — this could be a dramatic re-rating. But there are lots of moving parts, delays or overruns could kill the story.

NXXT-“Execution with dilution risk,” not a meme

The good: NXXT’s top line is actually ramping. Q2 FY25 revenue ~$19.7M was up ~166% YoY; 1H25 (~$36M) has already beaten full-year 2024 ($27.7M). Gross profit grew ~189% and margins ticked to ~8%. They keep bolting on real-world capacity (mobile fueling assets, Yoshi Mobility fuel division, Shell trucks) and lined up a strategic financing partner (Hudson Sustainable Group) to help fund higher-margin energy infra (microgrids, batteries, wireless EV charging). Insider alignment isn’t just talk—on Sept 18 the CEO converted $1.67M of company debt into 1M restricted shares at $1.67, de-levering while adding skin in the game.

The catch: The cap table is primed for more paper. On Sept 8 they structured up to $11.8M of senior secured convertible notes and stacked fresh warrants on top of legacy warrants-supportive if execution is crisp, dilutive if not. Margins are still single-digit and net tangible book was negative as of 6/30/25; they’re spending to scale, not gushing cash. Also note governance concentration (CEO ~59% voting power). Translation: there’s a real business and pipeline, but you must underwrite a path to better unit economics while watching conversions/warrant overhang like a hawk.

What to watch: gross margin trend >10–15%, funded/contracted microgrid or wireless-EV deployments (not just pilots), evidence that the Hudson partnership finances actual assets, and any new 424B/ATM activity that signals incremental dilution.

DVLT-Big headlines, thin fundamentals (bubble-tilted unless revenue inflects)

What moved it: A splashy “$150M strategic investment (in Bitcoin)” from Scilеx. Reality: only the initial tranche closed (15M shares); the rest is a pre-funded warrant pending a shareholder vote—highly dilutive at the implied price (~$0.54). They also РR’d conversion of $13.3M in convertible debt and trotted out MOUs/partner logos (e.g., Korea Aerospace University, IBM partner ecosystem). This cocktail drives momentum but doesn’t equal cash flow.

The numbers: Latest 10-Q shows Q2 revenue $1.74M, gross profit ~$35k (near zero margin), net loss $37.1M, and cash $0.66M at 6/30/25. Share count climbed (86.7M → ~97.7M by mid-Aug). The core story—“data monetization platform”—may be legitimate as a product direction, but commercialization remains unproven and financing relies on highly dilutive structures. If the second Scilеx tranche passes on shareholder-friendly terms and they start printing contracted revenue with positive gross margin, the bear case weakens; until then, you’re trading headlines over fundamentals.

What to watch: the shareholder vote and final terms on the second Scilеx tranche (lockups, resets), updated cash runway vs quarterly burn, movement from MOUs → signed paying customers, and any 424B/registration activity enabling more resale.

ATCH-Real broker-dealer asset, still a financing-heavy turnaround

What it is: АtlasClear isn’t vapor; it owns Wilson-Davis & Co. (WDCO), a self-clearing broker-dealer operating since 1968, with revenue from commissions, clearing and stock loan. That’s a bona fide base business.

Why it ran: Late-Sept cadence of updates: FY25 results/corporate update (9/29), IR/board moves, new correspondent clears, stock-loan growth, plus talk of a $45M Hаnire LLC financing reworked into two tranches (equity + converts) and two Hаnire board seats if it closes. Micro-cap playbook: thin float + “rescue” capital + turnaround narrative = momentum.

The numbers: FY25 (year ended 6/30/25) revenue $10.86M; loss from operations $(4.92)M. Reported net income $5.75M was flattered by non-operating/one-time items-it doesn’t mean operating health is fixed. To bridge the gap, they used expensive paper (short-term notes with 20% OID, a 10% convertible debenture) and keep an ATM handy. The Hаnire cash-if and when it lands-could be transformative or dilutive depending on covenants, resets, and board influence.

What to watch: whether Hаnire actually funds (final terms), operating EBITDA/cash-flow traction at WDCO, the Commercial Bancorp of Wyoming acquisition status (banking stack), and any new converts/ATMs that expand float.

Bottom line-which is most legit for investors vs. traders?

For investors (multi-quarter hold): NXXT screens best. It has real, accelerating revenue and strategic partners, with identifiable levers (microgrids/wireless EV) to lift margins. The bear case is dilution + thin margins, but you can model progress quarter by quarter. ATCH is second: real revenue asset but still operating-loss-heavy and dependent on expensive/dilutive funding. DVLT is last—too much valuation resting on future votes, warrants, and MOUs rather than durable unit economics today.

For traders (headline/flow driven): DVLT and ATCH offer the cleaner momentum setups because catalysts are binary (votes, financings, PR cadence) and floats respond. Just recognize you’re playing structure (warrants/converts/ATMs) and news velocity, not fundamentals. NXXT can trend, but guard against financing headlines that cap spikes. Tight risk and a dilution tracker are mandatory.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1nzj9pj/i_jumped_deep_into_popular_stocks_in_this_sub_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1nzj9pj/i_jumped_deep_into_popular_stocks_in_this_sub_and/,cash flow;loan;valuation

I haven’t been here long, but I’ve already noticed how many bot accounts are flooding this sub. They push the same tickers nonstop, pretending there’s real momentum, when in reality it’s the same old pump-and-dump.

It took me a minute to catch on, but the accounts are easy to spot if you look. They’re brand new, nothing in their history except one—maybe two—tickers, and the same hype language repeated over…and over. The problem is, people are falling for it. They buy in, the pump ends, and they’re left bag-holding while whoever is behind the bots cashes out.

It’s shady, it’s unhelpful, and it ruins the chance for real conversation and sharing legitimate tips. My advice: always check the account before you even bother with their post. If it’s only a few days or hours old and spamming one ticker, it’s not worth your time or money. And some of you are investing A LOT of your hard-earned money.

I’m curious—what’s the most obvious or ridiculous bot spam you’ve seen in here? Or just share your thoughts on this. Because honestly, it’s getting out of hand. Maybe what we say will be taken seriously, and the bots will be kicked out.

China's newly announced policy of restricting Earth Earth materials sale to the US has Trump back on the trade warpath:
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-china-tariffs-rare-earth-elements/

We watched Lithium Americas ($LAC) sky rocket nearly 200% in days with the announcement of the US Government taking a stake out of strategic necessity. I'd been invested in $LAC for years waiting patiently and its been a great ride. But its just the beginning. The North American push to mine, manufacturer, and sell Rare Earth materials such as lithium is in it's infancy and ready to boom!

In the 1990's and early 2000's the US knew it had some of the largest oil reserves in the world locked in Shale, but couldn't manufacture crude oill from it an effective cost. Fast forward to today, it is the largest single source of crude oil in the United States. We're looking at this turning point in Lithium which is needed for car batteries, phones, vapes... hell just about everything! 

This week I'm looking at TRUE penny stocks that have potential to 100x, maybe not now, but for sure in the next 2-3 years. 

Closing prices from this week:
Lithium Corporation- LTUM- $0.15 Great stakes in mineral rich sites with potential growing
Imagine Lithium- ARXRF $0.03
Vision Lithium Inc- ABEPF $0.01
Avalon Advanced Materials Inc. AVLNF $0.09 (already up 218% in the last month)
American Rare Earths Limited- ARRNF $0.40 (already up 85% in the last month)

The potential for any one of these to jump over $2 in the short term, where LAC was sitting before a $50 million investment from GM and US Gov involvement, is just the beginning of a 10+ year journey we've already watched with crude oil.

And YES, I understand many of these are on Canadian soil, if that's where the materials are in the largest most concentrated abundance, then so be it. Canada is sitting on a value of Rare Earth that may have them looking like the rich oil Sheiks of the Middle East. I'm just hoping to be lambo rich on riding these Penny stocks to the moon. I'm already sitting on 400k+ shares across these and will be continuing to buy buy buy

(SCWO) NON-GPT Analysis --- Strong Foundation,"This will be a non-ai analysis based on my over 10+ hours of research. I am currently holding 7.500 shares @.50$. Stock has been building momentum for the last 2-3 days. My personal price target for next week is 2.50$. This is not a financial advice, and just my thoughts after deep research.

When I invest, I focus first on sectors solving real, global problems, especially those with a strong moat, capable leadership, and a path to financial scalability. SCWO checks all three boxes. Let’s start with the broader outlook

**1. Technology, Mission & DoD Contracts -- Strong Foundation**

As the ticker suggests, SCWO means Supercritical Water Oxidation, a NASA-proven tech, which is aimed at destroying organic hazardous wastes, especially PFAS (“forever chemicals”), Aqueous Film‑Forming Foam (AFFF), ion‑exchange resins, sludge, garden biosolids, etc. turning the world’s toughest waste into clean water, energy, and minerals. Traditional methods (landfill, incineration) are increasingly restricted, regulated, or expensive; AirSCWO offers a cleaner, more thorough solution. This gives the company strong regulatory tailwinds in the U.S. and abroad. [youtube video about PFAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC2eSujzrUY&)

The company has already secured multiple Department of Defense‑adjacent contracts and demonstration projects such as:

1. It has deployed its AS6 AirSCWO system to Detroit, Michigan, as part of a DoD ESTCP/DIU project, to treat multiple PFAS‑impacted waste streams. [globalnewswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/22/3119431/0/en/374Water-Delivers-AS6-System-to-Detroit-Michigan-for-DoD-ESTCP-DIU-Project.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
2. It is also participating in another DoD project with Colorado School of Mines and ESTCP, targeting PFAS treatment at Peterson Space Force Base, among other installations. [gurufocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2969348/374water-to-demonstrate-pfas-destruction-with-dod-estcp-and-colorado-school-of-mines-scwo-stock-news)
3. The U.S. Navy (NDCEE) selected 374Water to demonstrate AirSCWO at a naval installation, specifically for PFAS destruction on military bases. [nasdaqpressrelease](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/374water-selected-by-us-navy-for-joint-ndcee-project-to-demonstrate-374waters?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The reason I wanted to focus on DoD contracts is that U.S Military has bases all over the world (Asia, Europe). Environmental remediation including PFAS on these bases is a global interest. Demonstrations or installations at U.S. bases overseas or NATO/U.S.‑partnered bases could serve as beachheads in Europe/Asia.

Many European countries are tightening PFAS regulation; likewise, Asian countries (Japan, South Korea, Australia, etc.) are showing increasing concern. If SCWO’s AirSCWO system is proven under DoD / U.S. Navy specs, that gives it credibility in bids around the world or for foreign military / environmental cleanup contracts. Once you clear the “military base / defense installation” barrier, you often get access to **recurring contracts**, higher margins, and more trust --- all of which can be leveraged to enter non‑U.S. markets (Europe, Asia) where governments are similarly trying to address PFAS and environmental remediation.

**Partnerships with Local Waste Management/Environmental Firms**: Similar to the Crystal Clean partnership in the U.S., SCWO could partner with European and Asian TSDF‑like firms or environmental services providers, enabling them to localize operations, meet import/trade / regulatory requirements, and reduce logistics cost.

**Export / Licensing / Modular Units**: SCWO offers scalable systems (AS1, AS6, etc.). Smaller, modular systems can be exported or licensed. Also, governments often subsidize “green / clean tech” import or build‑local programs; SCWO could benefit.

**2.Financials**

While 374Water is not yet profitable, like almost all smalcaps --- with **Q2 2025 gross profit still negative at approximately ($0.3) million >** the company has shown **exceptional revenue growth**, typical of early-stage small-cap innovators. **Q2 2025 revenue came in at \~$600,000**, up from just $37,000 in Q2 2024 --- representing **1,500%+ year-over-year growth**.

Revenue sources include:

* **Demonstration projects** (e.g., Orlando biosolids facility)
* **Treatability studies**
* **Initial equipment sales**

These early engagements provide **critical customer validation** as SCWO moves toward commercialization.

The company is transitioning to a **recurring revenue model** through its **Waste Destruction Services (WDS)** business. A key milestone is the signed agreement with **Heritage-Crystal Clean** to deploy an **AirSCWO 6 system**, expected to generate **$3–5 million annually**, with potential expansion across multiple locations.

Looking further ahead, SCWO recently disclosed that it is **bidding on government contracts totaling up to $1.8 billion**, including long-term environmental remediation projects for military and federal agencies. Continued success in **Department of Defense (DoD) demonstration programs**—such as those at **Peterson Space Force Base and U.S. Navy installations**—could lead to high-value, recurring federal contracts.

The company’s momentum is further bolstered by **strategic backing**, including early funding support from **Breakthrough Energy Ventures**, led by **Bill Gates**. This affiliation not only strengthens SCWO’s financial credibility but also reinforces its positioning as a climate-tech solution targeting urgent waste and PFAS destruction needs.

**3. Management**

I always look where the management are graduated from. I love it when management are mostly engineers, means they know what they are doing. Their fields and overall backgrounds are superb. 2 days ago new CEO was appointed:

New CEO, **Stephen J. Jones** (ex-CMS Energy), is so confident in the mission that he’s **taking equity instead of cash ---** aligning his upside directly with shareholders. This shows strong insider confidence.

1. **Stephen J. Jones** — appointed Interim President & CEO (effective October 2025) [Stock Titan](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/SCWO/374water-appoints-stephen-j-jones-as-interim-president-and-chief-lmch25fqh2ef.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  • Education: BSc in Economics from Bloomsburg University (PA), MBA (Finance) from Temple University, Juris Doctor (Law) from University of Pennsylvania.
2. **Chris Gannon** — served as CEO prior to the interim appointment (from April 2024)  • Education: BSE (Engineering) from University of Michigan, MBA from University of Chicago Booth School of Business
3. **Jeffrey “Jeff” Quick** — was Interim CEO from September 2023 until April 2024  • Education: JD from Harvard Law School; BS in Accounting from University of Colorado, Boulder
4. Peter Mandel (General Council) J.D. from Stanford Law School; B.A. with honors from University of California, Berkeley
5. Raj Melkote (CTO) Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from University of Minnesota; B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Purdue University.
6. Brad Meyers (COO) BS Computer Science at L.I.U. C.W. Post (1986–1988)

**Catalysts Ahead:**

With a first-mover advantage in breakthrough PFAS destruction, SCWO is poised for intercontinental expansion --- from U.S. military bases to European allies and Asia’s industrial giants, global demand is lining up fast.

* SCWO already has a Western Asia subsidiary; this could serve as a “beachhead” for nearby markets (Middle East, South & Southeast Asia). [Access Newswire](https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/utilities/374water-expands-presence-to-western-asia-with-launch-of-new-subsidiary-691366?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

An announcement from the new CEO is expected imminently, possibly today or early next week, with updates on key project milestones, federal and DoD contract progress, and new strategic partnerships.

This company is getting sold before the end of the year...in fact, I'm calling my shot. I think this sells between September 8th and September 12th with my most likely date as the 12th. Why? I'll get to that after I explain these ""insider sells"" that I'm blown away that no one understands what is going on with - it's super simple and obvious.

  
Insider gets 2.5 million shares - at 53 cents per share that is $1,325,000. The CAPITAL GAINS on that would be...$265,000 that Doug has to pay right now. So he sold 500,000 shares at 53 cents which is...watch this...$265,000. Guys - come ON! It's 2nd grade math. Freaking out about ""an insider sale"" when you can clearly see that he is paying off the taxes on the gain is just wild.

Now, here's why I think this company gets sold on September 12th. Everyone at ELTP has worked so hard to get here. All the growth, all the records being smashed...it's time for a pay day. Who is the last person to get their piece of the pie? Kirko Kirkov who has millions of shares that are going to vest on September 7th. That's a Sunday. So Monday, he will file a form showing he is selling shares as well and it will also note his exercised and vested shares. His sell will be for the tax bill. Now that everyone has their shares on the books - they will then announce the sale of the company so that those executives all get their payout for their shares. It will be between the 8th and the 12th - my call is most likely the 12th so that they have 3 days for any additional disclosures they need to tie things up before the announcement on Friday the 12th.

The whole setup reminds me of $ATCH before it ran.

Here’s why it caught my eye: last quarter they pulled in $1.7M revenue, which is a 400%+ jump year over year. They’ve also got a $2.5M licensing deal with Nyiax lined up, not even fully recognized yet. For a tiny company with a market cap under $40M, that’s a big deal.

What makes it even more interesting is their patent portfolio – over 70 patents covering wireless audio, data management, machine learning. It’s not just some AI-in-the-name shell, they’ve actually got IP that can be monetized. On top of that, an entity tied to the CEO picked up 10M shares recently, which at least shows insiders are putting skin in the game.

Of course, this isn’t risk-free. They’re still losing money, dilution is a possibility, and the volatility here is no joke. But if they even get close to the $25M run rate they’re guiding for by the end of 2025, today’s price could look insanely cheap.

Feels like one of those plays where you either get in early and take the gamble, or you end up watching it from the sidelines when it starts moving.

DD: 374Water ($SCWO) develops and commercializes a technology called AirSCWO — supercritical water oxidation. This process effectively destroys organic contaminants in wastewater, industrial effluent, and hazardous waste streams — including PFAS and other “forever chemicals.”

The company operates under two business models:

as a technology provider, selling and deploying AirSCWO systems, and

as a service operator through a Destruction-as-a-Service (DaaS) model, generating recurring revenue by treating waste instead of selling equipment outright.

📊 Contracts, Partnerships & Pipeline

Reported pipeline and backlog total around $1.8 billion, including signed orders and ongoing project negotiations.

Clients and active projects include the Orange County Sanitation District, the City of Orlando, and pilot programs in Idaho targeting PFAS and biosolids destruction.

374Water is in discussions with several TSDF operators (Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities) to install AirSCWO systems at existing waste-handling sites — enabling faster scale-up without building new infrastructure.

The company already holds signed contracts for equipment sales, pilot testing, and demonstration systems.

Partnership with Crystal Clean aims to build a destruction-service facility in Ohio under a revenue-sharing model.

During the Q2 2025 earnings call, management highlighted ongoing projects with the City of Orlando focused on municipal waste treatment and AFFF (firefighting foam) destruction. The Orlando site is positioned as a showcase project for eliminating PFAS from wastewater using AirSCWO.

⚙️ Upcoming Catalyst

“374Water and OC San are awaiting the receipt of final permits to operate the AirSCWO system, with potential approval before year-end.”
(from the latest update on their WDS and AirSCWO development efforts)

💡 Summary

There’s no delisting risk until January 12, and the company holds a strong project pipeline.
Once the pending contracts and partnerships start moving and that $1.8B pipeline begins converting into revenue, many expect significant upside — with some independent analyses placing a price target around $2.50.

First things first - before you invest/gamble in penny stocks, you should have your life in order. Pay your bills, call your mom, put money in your retirement accounts, etc. We're all here chasing that dopamine rush, but you don't have to be a degenerate about it. Now, with that out of the way...

Diversification - You should diversify outside of Penny stocks. If Penny stocks are more than 50% of your portfolio, I hope you're still in school. 5% is probably the right number, but that's not why we're here, so let's call it 10-20%. *Inside* of Penny stocks? Honestly, don't diversify. Most tickers you see here are on a downward trajectory long term. Blame management, algos, shorts, or whatever you want, but they aren't going up. Diversifing here isn't like trying to catch a falling knife, it's trying to catch multiple falling knives. Diversify your watchlist, but concentrate your penny stocks (up to whatever percent of your portfolio you've decided).

Timing - As I said previously, most tickers here are on a downtrend. These are not what you buy and hold in your retirement account. This is not where Buffett shops. Just because it's gone down doesn't mean it has to go up. Penny stocks are a dream for swing trading. A good PR for these companies at these market caps can lead to significant multi day runs. You don't have to catch the bottom or the top, there is plenty of money to be made in the middle 60%. Penny stocks trade more on momentum/sentiment, less on fundamentals. Move in, and move out. Typically I'll buy in when there is a good PR starting an uptrend and a secondary catalyst in the near future (~1 month tops). If a secondary catalyst is further away, I'll add to my watchlist and wait for my bones to tell me it's time to buy (if ever).

Greed - Okay, while I am telling you to jump on hype trains, the important part is not to get caught up in the hype train. Don't miss your exit.   20-100% plays can be faster and more repeatable than 100-1,000% plays. If you suffer from FOMO and see a run continuing, then sure hold onto some shares for science, but trim enough of your position so you've made money for the next trade. Usually when a stock gets popular, the bulls will have some consensus on price targets. I usually cut that price roughly in half for my target. 

Cut your losers - You have to be willing to admit defeat here. You got the timing wrong, management sucks, the world is out to get you, and I'm sorry. Take a page out of Chumbawamba's book and get up again. It's harder to do that if you ride tickers to -90%. Set a stop loss (or pay attention) and get out before a stock gives you PTSD. Make money somewhere else and buy in again when the price has settled/new catalysts are coming.

Reverse splits - Ideally you took my advice and aren't holding any of these long enough to experience a RS, but if that's not the case, just sell if one is announced. Maybe you'll want to buy in again, but in the present moment you do not want to own that stock. The number of stocks that RS and then climb in the near future is near zero. Hoping your stock is the exception is like jumping out of an airplane and hoping you land on a bounce house.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1nzq3x2/a_few_bits_of_advice_for_anyone_starting_out_here/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1nzq3x2/a_few_bits_of_advice_for_anyone_starting_out_here/,cut

Hyperscale Data is in the middle of a transformation — moving from a broad holding structure to a focused operator in AI data infrastructure and digital asset mining.
They own a massive 617,000 sq ft facility (on ~34.5 acres) in Michigan, currently being expanded for dual use:

- *High-Performance Computing (AI / HPC) workloads*

- *Bitcoin mining operations*

Their subsidiaries include Sentinum Inc. (for hosting, colocation, and mining) and Ault Capital Group, which they plan to spin off to streamline operations around core infrastructure.

Recent Developments & Catalysts

- *Debt Reduction (~$30M):*
GPUS just eliminated around $30 million in non-affiliated debt. That’s huge for a company this size — it frees up capital and improves the balance sheet for expansion and investor confidence.

- *AI + Bitcoin Infrastructure Expansion:*
The Michigan facility is being upgraded to support enterprise-grade AI compute and high-efficiency mining. Power capacity expansion is already underway.

- *New Mining Fleet:*
They’ve ordered 1,000 Bitmain Antminer S21s, with a plan to scale up to 5,000 units (≈20MW capacity). All mined BTC will be held on balance sheet as part of a long-term $100M Bitcoin treasury strategy.

*For context: the entire company’s market cap is around $12M, less than 1/8 of their target Bitcoin holdings alone. The math is easy.*

*Why It Matters*

- *Cleaner Balance Sheet*: debt elimination gives them room to reinvest and scale faster.

- *Dual Focus Model*: combining AI hosting + mining provides two strong revenue streams that hedge each other.

- *Scalability*: The infrastructure is already in place, expansion just adds throughput and recurring cash flow potential.

If management executes on their stated goals, completing the Michigan expansion, scaling miners, and growing hosting revenue, it’s not unrealistic to see a significant re-rating in 2025.

submission,1o1h7pg,,BopJuice,2025-10-08T17:37:08+00:00,pennystocks,182,55,0.97,Why Kraken Robotics is the best Anduril proxy on the market (DD),"Ok, this is my first long-form DD so take it easy on me lol

**TL;DR: Kraken Robotics is the primary public supplier for Anduril's underwater drone manufacturing ramp. Anduril just opened a facility designed to produce 200+ units per year. Each unit carries $2M-$10M of Kraken content. The stock has run but the revenue hasn't hit yet. Meanwhile, defense spending on autonomous systems is accelerating globally as underwater infrastructure becomes a critical national security concern. If you can wait 2-3 years, this setup feels very strong.**

**//**

**What Kraken actually does (and where they've screwed up before):**

Kraken Robotics ($KRKNF - US OTC // $PNG - Toronto Stock Exchange) started in c.2012 when CEO Karl Kenny decided traditional sonar companies were charging too much for garbage technology. His pitch (as far as I can see from a few old company videos) was simple: build synthetic aperture sonar that could image the ocean floor in high definition instead of the blurry mess everyone else was selling at the time.

For the first several years, Kraken was your typical struggling tech startup. They burned cash, missed revenue targets, and had to keep going back to the market for dilutive financing. In 2017 they did a massive rollback (reverse split) that defo pissed off early shareholders. The company was losing money consistently through 2020, and their stock traded under $0.20 CAD for years. I think it's fair to say that their mission remained viable (and potentially valuable), but obviously hardware is fucking TRENCHES and teething issues are almost inevitable.

But they kept improving the technology and eventually figured out the business model. Instead of just selling sonar systems, they vertically integrated: they built their own high-energy-density batteries (rated to 6,000m depth) and started manufacturing complete autonomous underwater vehicles like the Thunderfish and Catfish. This also gave them three revenue streams instead of one (as well as opening their business model up to **recurring revenue**, which of course is king).

**How they make money:**

About 75% of revenue comes from product sales: sonar systems, batteries, and complete underwater vehicles. The remaining 25% is services, where Kraken operates the equipment themselves for customers who need seafloor mapping or infrastructure inspection.

Their main customers are navies, defense contractors, and offshore energy companies. Gross margins are pretty strong (around 50% on products, up to 75% on services) because the barriers to entry are high. Obviously you can't exactly just spin up a synthetic aperture sonar business overnight lol.

The business went from $12M CAD revenue in 2020 to $91M in 2024, a 65% CAGR (this is objectively a very strong CAGR for any company). They finally turned profitable in 2022 and are now running 20%+ net margins. From what I can see, management is guiding for $100-130M CAD in 2025 (sources differ, but general consensus seems to be 9 figures CAD).

**The plan going forward**:

Kraken is building a 60,000 square foot battery manufacturing facility in Nova Scotia that will triple their current production capacity by late 2025. The timing and location (not far from Anduril's Rhode Island facility) is not a coincidence imo. They're gearing up to supply what could become hundreds of millions in annual orders.

**//**

**At the helm:**

Karl Kenny (Former Founder & CEO, Rest in Peace) spent decades in marine technology before starting Kraken. He worked at C-CORE (a marine research center) so it's fair to say he has world-class alpha in understanding the various customer pain points firsthand. This doesn't seem like some software guy pivoting into hardware. He knew sonar, he knew the defense procurement process, and he knew offshore energy. Watch any video of Karl eg:([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9eGwmRdPtg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9eGwmRdPtg)) and it's clear he is technical, articulate and doesn't deal in buzzwords or hype. He can also explain really complex underwater acoustics in plain English, which makes me (personally) quite bullish on his founder credibility / likability. Also, the fact that he stuck with the company through years of losses and dilution shows conviction.

He's also been smart about capital allocation. Rather than trying to do everything in-house, Kraken acquired PanGeo Subsea in 2020 to bolt on their services business. That acquisition has been accretive and gave them recurring revenue to smooth out the lumpiness of product sales.

Karl sadly passed in February this year, but it's fair to say the lion's share of the company's formation up until today was strongly informed by his leadership, hence why I bring him up at all.

I won't pretend to know anything super tangible or useful about the rest of the management team, but it seams appropriately lean and technical. New CEO Greg Reid has been with the company since 2018 and has defense industry experience. They don't seem to be overpaying themselves relative to the business size etc. Insider ownership is meaningful but not absurdly concentrated etc. Certainly no major red flags here (but by all means open to intel here from anyone better-researched).

**//**

**The Anduril Situation:**

For those of you who have been living under a rock and don't know who Anduril are, the tldr is essentially: Palmer Luckey (eccentric Hawaiian shirted VR genius who sold Oculus to Facebook for $2B at age 21) started a defense tech company that's now worth c.$30B private. They make autonomous weapons systems, sentry towers, interceptor missiles, and increasingly, **underwater drones**.

Palmer Luckey's underwater drone army runs on Kraken components. When Anduril decided to get into maritime autonomy, they acquired Dive Technologies in 2022. Dive was already using Kraken sonar and batteries in their autonomous subs. Post-acquisition, Anduril evaluated alternatives and decided to stick with Kraken. Not because they were lazy, but because the technology was genuinely the best available. Palmer has more than enough funding (and crucially, *reason*) to strip out a whole suite of components if there was a better alternative.

**The product lineup**:

Anduril's underwater systems all rely on Kraken:

1. **DiveLD**: 18-foot autonomous submarines capable of 10-day missions at depths up to 6,000m. Each unit carries approximately **$2M CAD worth of Kraken sonar and batteries**.
2. **Ghost Shark XL**: The big boy. An underwater truck that carries around **$10M CAD of Kraken technology** per unit.

(Anduril is also developing other underwater systems like **Copperhead** (a battery-powered torpedo drone) and **Seabed Sentry** (an underwater monitoring system). While it's reasonable to assume these could use Kraken batteries given the existing relationship, this hasn't been publicly confirmed.)

**The manufacturing ramp that (hopefully) changes everything:**

In 2024, Anduril opened a 100,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Rhode Island. This factory is designed to produce **up to 200 DiveLD vehicles per year at full capacity**, plus Ghost Shark XLs and other products.

In 2024, Anduril opened a 100,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Rhode Island. This factory is designed to produce **up to 200 DiveLD vehicles per year at full capacity**, plus Ghost Shark XLs and other products.

Let's do the math on just 50% utilization:

* 100 DiveLDs per year × $2M content per unit = **$200M CAD annual revenue**
* Add in even 20 Ghost Shark XLs × $10M content = another **$200M CAD**

That's $400M in potential annual revenue from Anduril alone, which is more than 4x Kraken's entire 2024 revenue of $91M.

**To be clear, these contracts are already signed:**

This isn't speculative. Australia awarded Anduril a **$1B USD contract** for dozens of Ghost Shark XL platforms over 5 years, including co-funding a second manufacturing facility. The US Navy selected Anduril's platforms for their Replicator program and has already taken delivery of units. Japan, South Korea, and the UK are evaluating deployments.

The Australian contract alone implies significant ongoing production. If even half these programs reach scale, Anduril could be manufacturing hundreds of UUVs annually by 2027-2028.

**Why Kraken should be locked in:**

A valid initial worry could be raised about customer concentration risk. What if Anduril switches suppliers? etc: I think that's very unlikely, for a few reasons. First, switching costs in defense are enormous. Once a technology is integrated and tested in prototypes, navies won't tolerate delays from component changes. Kraken's tech was chosen after competitive evaluations. Second, literally Anduril operates on a ""innovate or die"" philosophy. They stuck with Kraken because the performance is legitimately superior, not out of convenience. Thirdly, the US has hard 2027 goals for UUV deployment. IMO it would be wild to re-validate new suppliers this late, especially with no obviously superior supplier in sight.

**What if Anduril collapses tomorrow?**

To be clear, whilst I personally think this is an amazing Anduril proxy-stock - other revenue streams are growing too. To name a few:

**Huntington Ingalls** (one of the largest US shipbuilders) uses Kraken components in their Remus underwater vehicles through their Hydroid subsidiary.

**Offshore energy** continues to be a solid customer base. Oil and gas companies need pipeline inspection, and offshore wind is growing. Kraken's Thunderfish and services business serve this market.

**International navies** are buying directly. Kraken has contracts with the Canadian Navy, German Navy, and others for mine countermeasure systems.

**Deep sea mining** is an emerging opportunity. With critical minerals on the ocean floor and Trump signing executive orders to expedite offshore mining permits, demand for seafloor mapping could explode. Kraken often gets cited as the future 'Google Maps' of the ocean, for instance. I chose not to delve too deeply into this side of things as there are (currently) no clear, tangible revenue routes in the pipeline for this, so I am treating any quips of this line as a bit baseless / pumpy even. But deep sea mining is 100% a growing sector, and there is fair reason to believe that Kraken will find a way to get a slice of the (huge) pie.

Also - two bonus titbits here:

Their services business grew c.47% in 2024 and provides recurring revenue, what's not to love there.

CEO Greg Reid has publicly stated Kraken expects to land another XL UUV manufacturer contract this year beyond Anduril. Imo this would be one of the biggest bullish needle-movers for the stock, as they would prove beyond any doubt that this isn't a one-customer Anduril hard-carry.

**//**

**The Kraken Moat:**

Kraken is basically really really hard to compete with. The technology barriers are real / Developing cutting-edge synthetic aperture sonar and deep-sea batteries takes years of expertise / Kraken has a 10+ year head start etc

More importantly, they control the entire stack: sensors, power, and vehicles. Most competitors specialize in one piece. The only other companies offering complete packages are defense primes like Lockheed + Northrop Grumman. Kraken offers similar capabilities at a fraction of the cost. Also, **(and I am speculating here, to be clear)** for any future company (like Anduril) that prides itself on moving fast and iterating quickly, working with a nimble supplier that can adapt and customize etc beats dealing with the bureaucracy and long lead times of traditional defense giants.

**Potential Catalysts**:

1. **NASDAQ uplisting**: The company trades on Toronto Venture Exchange and OTC in the US. A NASDAQ uplisting would unlock institutional buying and dramatically increase liquidity (it kinda sucks right now..). They'd need a sustained price around $4 USD for 90 days. Currently trading around $4.45 USD as of today, October 8th.
2. **Anduril production milestones**: Any announcement about facility ramp-up, delivery schedules, or new contracts will move the stock. We saw this in September 2024 when the Australian Ghost Shark contract drove shares up 17% in one day.
3. **The second XL UUV customer**: Management has telegraphed this is coming in 2025. It would validate that multiple defense primes are standardizing on Kraken technology.
4. **Anduril IPO hype**: Anduril is probably the most anticipated private company IPO (I will be buying the shit out of it personally). As it enters mainstream discourse, investors will discover Kraken as the only public proxy play.

**//**

**Why this won't 100x:**

I despise pumpers as much as the rest of you so let's be sane about this

**To be clear, this is not a wildcard lottery play where you will 100x your money.**

I've thought long and hard about roughly where we are. Kraken stock is up roughly 150% since the start of this year. The market has obviously figured out the Anduril connection. This isn't a secret stock - the market cap is over a billion dollars.

But here's the thing: the actual revenue from Anduril's manufacturing ramp hasn't shown up in the numbers yet. We're still in the anticipation phase. The Rhode Island facility just opened. The Australian contract just got signed. The production scale-up is happening in 2025-2027.

For what it's worth, I've been in multiple situations like this. I bought Rocket Lab at $10 after it had more than doubled in a few months from $4. Obviously never feels great buying at the top. I'm still holding today (where it sits at $65) and clearly that was a strong play. Same with ASTS at $18 after it had quite literally tripled. Basically I'm just trying to get inb4 'bUt iT rOsE sO mUcH'. My point being, if you are only looking for flat line graphs, I can guarantee most of those will continue plateauing anyway or you would ironically not want to put money into the stock to begin with.

tldr: this stock has gone up. I think it will go up a lot more when the revenue materializes / catalysts hit.

**The valuation isn't crazy:**

Kraken trades at a trailing PE of about 85. Compare that to other mid-cap drone stocks: AVAV trades at 152 PE, Kratos at 451 PE. Imo the market is giving Kraken less credit despite arguably better growth prospects. Let's not forget that Kraken is growing at 65% CAGR with 20%+ net margins (and ostensibly another XL UUV manufacturer contract in the pipeline, this year)

**//**

**What could go wrong?**

To me, the biggest risk by far is execution. Can they actually scale production fast enough? The new battery facility needs to come online smoothly. Any delays will hurt the stock for sure.

Second risk is lumpy defense revenue. Government contracts can shift quarters unexpectedly, creating volatility. If you're going to own this, I think you need to stomach drawdowns as and when they happen - especially given the stock has ran a fair bit this year.

General recession is also a risk, though at this point most of our positions would be screwed lol. If the broader market craters, small cap Canadian tech will get hit hard regardless of fundamentals. (That said, defense spending tends to be relatively counter-cyclical and the current underwater drone buildout is driven by genuine national security, rather than 'tech trends').

I could also be wrong about the Anduril revenue scale. Maybe they ramp slower than expected. Maybe gross margins compress as they scale. Maybe the contracts get cut. These are unavoidable for any company relying on fewer, larger contracts to fuel their growth. It's basically the buy-in to having the equal opposite at any time (eg: a massive orgasmic DOD contract)

**My take on the next 2-3 years:**

If Anduril executes even close to plan, Kraken should be doing $300-500M revenue by 2027. At 25% EBITDA margins (conservative given current margins), that's $75-125M EBITDA. Apply a 25-35x multiple and you get to $10-20 CAD per share by 2027, depending on assumptions.

Current price is around $4.45. That's 2-5x upside over the next 2 years or so if things go right. Not life-changing money overnight, but imo excellent risk-reward for a company with real technology, real contracts, and a clear path to scale.

**//**

**It's a bitch to buy (but I maintain that this is a good thing):**

Kraken is not on Robinhood afaik, so you'll need a broker that handles international stocks or OTC markets. Interactive Brokers, Schwab, and Fidelity all support it I think - and for the Brits you can buy on Trading212 (in ISA too!).

Liquidity is a bit ass at market open but it's not a liquid large cap either. I would not advise market ordering this thing. Use limits lol.

I actually like the fact it isn't on the largest retail trading broker yet - an uplisting / feature on robinhood would almost certainly boost the stock and open it up to more institutional investment

submission,1nt9pnp,,investak,2025-09-29T05:19:24+00:00,pennystocks,179,68,0.95,Here is the $PSTV DD that everyone is looking for.,"Holding 3.3k commons at $0.48 ave, going to hold until +$5 over the next 12 months. Not here for short-term penny flipping.

Traded this back in August before the REYOBIQ PR catalyst and came back with UNH news last week.

\*AI polished the DD using all the sources I gave her.\*

  


# 🔑 TL;DR

* **PSTV’s CNSide** is the only diagnostic that can *truly* replace outdated CNS metastases detection methods (CSF cytology, MRI follow-ups, etc.)
* It enables **multi-timepoint testing** throughout a cancer patient’s journey: early diagnosis → treatment monitoring → recurrence detection.
* The **TAM is massive (multi-billion $)** and even modest penetration could mean a valuation many multiples above today’s \~$61M market cap.
* Recent catalysts (**CLIA accreditation Sept 18** \+ **UnitedHealthcare national coverage Sept 26**) have pulled the commercialization timeline forward dramatically.
* With more good news expected, PSTV could re-rate fast enough that Nasdaq compliance by November won’t even require a reverse split.

  


🧬 Why CNSide Is the Slient Game Changer in CNS Cancer Diagnostics

* **Current Standard of Care is Broken**
   * CSF cytology = low sensitivity (\~40–50%), often misses LM on first try
   * MRI = expensive, not reliable for microscopic disease, cannot quantify tumor cells
* **CNSide Advantages**
   * Direct CSF tumor cell enumeration with immunofluorescence markers
   * **3–10x higher sensitivity** than cytology (Source: [https://ir.plustherapeutics.com/static-files/e0553987-4ab1-4daa-97b8-4bbdd2c17233](https://ir.plustherapeutics.com/static-files/e0553987-4ab1-4daa-97b8-4bbdd2c17233) )
   * Quantitative, reproducible results → actionable clinical data
   * Works for both **diagnosis AND monitoring**, enabling repeated tests over the course of treatment

👉 Translation: CNSide isn’t just an “incremental improvement.” It’s a **paradigm shift** that oncologists *need* and payors *want* (cheaper than MRI, more actionable than cytology).

  


# 📊 Market Size (TAM/SAM/SOM)

* **LM confirmed patients**: 150k–200k in the U.S.
   * Each needs 3–4 tests/year
   * At $2,800/test → **$12B–22B annual TAM**
* **High-risk cancer survivors (lung, breast HER2+, melanoma, hematologic)**: 7–8M patients in U.S.
   * Even 10% uptake × 2 tests/year = \~$4B+ opportunity

👉 **Total U.S. TAM easily $20–30B+**, with global TAM at least double that. So the 6B TAM PR-ed by $PSTV was super duper conservative.



💰 Valuation Math

* Current market cap = \~$61M (@$0.61/share)
* Apply even **5% U.S. TAM capture = $1–1.5B revenues**
* At conservative **P/S = 5x** → **$5–7.5B valuation**
* That’s **80–120x upside** vs today’s price

Yes, it sounds insane. But the math is the math. The real question is adoption speed.

  


# ⏱️ Timeline Acceleration

* **Sept 18, 2025**: CLIA accreditation secured → regulatory gate unlocked
* **Sept 26, 2025**: UnitedHealthcare national coverage → immediate insurance access for **51M lives**
* Next steps (already hinted by mgmt/analysts):
   * **Major lab partnerships** (Labcorp, Quest, or top cancer centers)
   * State licensure across 48 states
   * Medicare/Medicaid enrollment
* Originally, mgmt said nationwide adoption could take 12 months. With UHC on board, that’s likely cut to 3-6 months.

  
📉 Nasdaq Compliance Risk?

* Current deadline: mid-Nov to regain $1 minimum bid
* But if commercialization momentum + coverage news flow continue, 👉 The stock may not *need* a reverse split.
* By then, clinical adoption + investor realization of TAM could naturally drive PSTV >$1.

When you talk about a stock’s upside potential, most people focus on **price**. That’s a mistake.  

The **price per share** means nothing on its own.  
A $0.10 stock can be “expensive,” while a $5 stock can be “cheap.” What **mathematically matters** is **market capitalization** and, even more importantly, the **float**:

- **Market Cap**: The total value of all outstanding shares of a company. It’s the most direct measure of how much the market values a company as a whole.  
- **Float**: The number of shares actually available for public trading.  

A stock with **both low market cap and low float** can move much faster than one with higher values.

| GPUS   | 14             | 25         | 1.78           |

**Analysis:**  
- **YYAI** is by far the lightest stock: Market cap $3M + float under 5M makes it possible that a few million dollars in buying pressure could cause exponential price movement.  
- **SCWO, BURU, SHOT, and PCSA** have floats large relative to their market caps — meaning they need significantly more capital inflow to move the price meaningfully.  
- **GPUS** is in the middle, with low market cap (14M) and moderate float.

They just got the CE Mark for FemBloc, the first non-surgical permanent birth control system approved in Europe, and early orders are already coming in from Spain. The rollout across other countries is on the horizon, and imo that alone is a pretty big deal.

On top of that, they’ve got FDA trials underway in the U.S. for some of their other women’s health devices, and the recent $8 million financing gives them the runway to actually get products out there and into more markets. Being added to the Russell Microcap Growth Index will also bring in some extra eyes and volume.

There’s a bunch of catalysts lined up: upcoming revenue updates, more European launches, and clinical readouts. For a microcap that’s flying a bit under the radar, it’s the kind of story that could quietly pop if everything clicks. Currently sitting at $0.48, but analysts have it averaging $5.67 👀.

 Datavault AI Inc. (Nasdaq: DVLT), a leader in AI-driven data visualization, valuation, and monetization, today announced that Nathaniel Bradley will present at and exhibit Datavault AI technologies in Seoul, South Korea at the XRP Seoul 2025 conference this Sunday, September 22, one of the largest technology and innovation conferences globally.

Nathaniel Bradley, CEO of Datavault AI said, “Our solutions have captured the attention of corporations throughout the world that have come to realize the power, cost savings and revenue potential of advanced data valuation and monetization. In Seoul, we look forward to strengthening relationships with international customers and pursuing scalable revenue and licensing opportunities across the Asia-Pacific region.” 


Datavault AI recently reported recognized revenue of $1.7 million for Q2 2025, reflecting a 467% year-on-year increase from $0.3 million in Q2 2024. The company also secured a $2.5 million licensing agreement with Nyiax Inc., which was booked in Q2 but is not yet recognized as revenue. The agreement is to be paid in Nyiax stock.

With a low market value and notable dilution risks, the stock is highly volatile. If Datavault can effectively scale its licensing revenue and manage cash, the upside potential could be significant; conversely, failure to do so could lead to substantial downside risks.

Management has set a target of reaching a $25 million annual revenue run rate by the end of 2025, and $40–50 million revenue in 2026.

Datavault AI's revenue surged 467% year-on-year in Q2.

A $2.5 million licensing deal with Nyiax Inc. could boost future revenues.

Recent insider transactions may indicate both confidence and dilution risks.

I’m not calling this a sure bet, far from it, but from what I’ve seen over the past weeks, it’s one worth watching closely.

So here’s the thing you guys: over the past two weeks they locked in a national coverage agreement with UnitedHealthcare for their CNSide diagnostic kit, which instantly opened us access to 50M+ people in the U.S. Adoption is already growing, with 120+ cancer centers using it, and the numbers actually look solid. Accuracy is very very VERY high in peer-reviewed studies. One of their Houston lab just got federal accreditation, which clears the way for broader reimbursement and rollout.

Financially, they aren’t killing it yet. Like any small biotech, they’re still burning cash and losing money… buuut they just pulled in another $1.9M non-dilutive grant from CPRIT, part of a bigger $17.6M award backing their REYOBIQ radiotherapeutic program for CNS cancers. That’s not pocket change - institutions don’t hand out that kind of money unless they see something real. What’s keeping me cautious though is the Nasdaq angle. They already regained compliance on equity (sitting at ~$3M vs. the $2.5M minimum), but they’re still under pressure with the $1 minimum bid rule. Deadline is Nov 12, 2025. Basically it’s like a piñata full of cash hanging by a thread - either they keep climbing and stay listed, or we risk a rough delisting scenario.

Personally? I grabbed a small starter. It’s not DVLT-level hype yet, but the catalysts are stacking. If the UHC deal brings in real revenue and they manage to hold compliance, this could rip. If not, I’m fine cutting. Feels mid-risk, mid-reward - the kind of play where you don’t go all-in, but you don’t ignore it neither. DVLT was the first that made noise for me and I hope my post about it made some of you money too, PSTV might be the next. What do you guys think?

📌 Key Details:  

\- Decision Date: September 4, 2025  

\- Classification: Substantially Equivalent (SESE)  

\- Device: LIBERTYOS (Endovascular Robotic System)  

\- Specialty: Cardiovascular procedures  

\- Clinical Trials: NCT06141694  



💡 Why it matters:  

This clearance is a major milestone. LIBERTY is designed as a single-use robotic platform that reduces costs, eliminates reprocessing risks, and enhances safety for endovascular surgeries. With a $30B+ target market, FDA clearance sets the stage for commercialization and potential partnerships.  



📊 Investor Angle:  

\- MBOT has struggled as a penny stock but this is a real catalyst.  

\- FDA clearance removes a huge overhang of uncertainty.  

\- Next step: commercialization, sales scaling, and potential licensing deals.

My main portfolio is mostly growth stocks, but I also invest in penny stocks since the potential returns can be huge. 

One problem I used to have when I got into penny stocks was getting timely **info to make quick decisions**. Most of the time it feels like you need 10 tabs open just to track a single ticker.

Some of you might already know these tricks, but I figured they could help newer investors:

**1. Reddit Trends Tab (desktop only for now)**

Go to the search bar → type in your keyword/ticker → click the “Trends” tab.

Add the keyword, and Reddit will show you popular posts with that keyword from the past few days/weeks.   
  
I tried this with *ATCH* and it saved me a ton of scrolling through different subs.   
This is what it look like:

 **2. Google Alerts**

Head to[ Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts) and enter the ticker name (or any keyword). The best thing is you can adjust delivery frequency (as-it-happens, daily, weekly).

Then whenever there’s fresh market news about your stock, Google sends you an email update.

There is also this tool that lets you enter stocks you’re planning to buy (or already own) and then sends case studies showing how similar stocks crashed and why.

I tested it with a few tickers, and it sent me 3 examples of stocks that looked strong but ended up falling apart. 

I can’t post it here since it might break this sub’s rules, but you can find it on my profile. If you want to try it, it’s pinned at the top

**Nothing fancy here, but honestly, these two tools give me timely info and save me hours of bouncing between sites and Twitter.**

Here’s why everyone is bullish on NUAI:

NUAI just got a deal to build a 1,600 mile AI-ready fiber network across the state of Texas. They're providing the power, space, and network capacity that AI data centers and AI companies need but can't/dont want to build themselves.

So in a nutshell...they're going to make AI data centers less dependent on the strained Texas power grid and ensure steady energy supply (I live in Texas, and trust me...this is a big deal).

On top of this...they're planning a 250 MW on-site ""power island"" and longer term 1 GW capacity to directly feed AI and hyperscale data centers.

Pay close attention to it. I'm super bullish on it but what are your thoughts guys?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1nl2rsr/nuai_is_the_ai_infrastructure_stock_to_10x_next/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1nl2rsr/nuai_is_the_ai_infrastructure_stock_to_10x_next/,

It seemed quite clear that the stock was significantly undervalued. I was unable to identify another phase 2 stage clinical trial with such compelling results.

Indeed, CGTX has experienced a substantial increase in value over the past few weeks, and it is possible that it may even face a significant downturn next week, as nobody can predict tomorrow's stock price, but I intend to maintain my position in the stock even if its value is reduced by half on Monday. My reasoning is rooted in my continued belief in its undervaluation, which I have previously elaborated upon in my earlier post.

In essence, the core objective of pennystocks involves identifying a company like this, a hidden gem. We all aspire to discover the next Nvidia, and opportunities are consistently available, but to find one, it is essential to conduct thorough research on the company and the industry, rather than relying solely on paid stock analysis sites.

I also experienced a period of loss with CGTX, but I persisted in increasing my investment because I had faith in the information I had read, studied, and evaluated about the company.

My initial awareness of CGTX stemmed from a DD post on this sub, which appeared persuasive, and I dedicated several hours, then days to verify the information before making an investment decision. It is advisable not to solely depend on the opinions of others; instead, invest time in conducting your own research, and avoid relying solely on AI LLMs, using them only for quick reference purposes.
There are many garbage stocks being introduced here but there are also real legit hidden gems, spend time to study!!

Looked at our expenses over the past year and really thought about what we are spending our money on, i realized we have been putting a lot into home improvements. We just did our last 2 big ones that feel really important to us over the summer, one of which will max us out for the home energy tax credit. Thinking about it more, if we start putting all of that extra money into savings, we should start to get on track for building up an emergency fund and having more money in savings. Also definitely going to start a budget and tracking our expenses for increased accountability with spending.

UPDATE 2: talked to my husband and apparently we have closer to $15k saved up in CDs, not $5k. So that makes sense as to where some of the money is going too.

My husband and I are currently making a combined amount of a little over $100k/year. We have no debt except for our mortgage, which is $1200/month.

I feel like with this amount of money being made, we should be saving significantly more but we’re not. We have a toddler and a baby, but no daycare expenses (I work half time and family watches them). After taxes, health insurance, retirement and payments for kids’ college, we only take home about $5000/month. After paying our mortgage, car insurance, utilities, and other expenses, we normally have a monthly savings of somewhere between $500 and $1000 that sit in our bank account.

We’ve put about $5000 into CDs that are a more long term savings in the past 2 years, but in terms of the monthly savings, the money quickly gets eaten up between home improvement projects, vacations, and unexpected expenses. We never don’t have enough to pay the bills, but I feel like we should be saving more overall with the amount we are making given our situation and how much we are making overall.

Thoughts? Are we spending way too much money if we are not really able to put more than a few thousand dollars/year into long term savings given our situation?

Edited to add: we live in a fairly high COL area (New England suburbs). Not crazy like NYC or Boston, but significantly more expensive than other parts of the country. Also, taxes are high here. We bought our house during COVID for a steal with a 2.5% interest rate, it was a major fixer upper and we have put probably around $100k into it so far, but are now at the point where there are no absolutely necessary home improvements.

My monthly expenses are approximately $825, and my annual salary is $72k. I contribute the maximum percentage amount I am allowed towards my 401k account (4.5%), with an 8% employer match. My 401k account currently has a balance of $13.7k. Below is a breakdown of how I’ve allocated my savings: 

* $48k = HYSA at 4.5% interest rate (temporary int. rate that will go down to 4% after 3mo)
* $120k = CD at 4.4% interest rate

The remainder of my savings are divided across my checking accounts. By the end of the year, I hope to have $190k in savings due to interest earnings, lump sum bonus and a salary increase. I do not foresee any large expenses within the next 2-3 years outside of some traveling I do once or twice a year. Do you have any suggestions on how I can maximize my savings or if I should be doing anything differently?

I'm not sure why I never thought of this, but it seems to be a fairly overlooked part of having an advisor that I never see talked about. I could also just be missing something.

Good Afternoon,
I work making 50-55k a year. I work with a lot of investors, as in they personally invest in many markets - they seem quite successful. My wife works 45k a year or so, she often switches jobs which has been hard for saving money.
Her mother, my mother in law - just won a large settlement, 250k - 50k lawyer fees, with some other things. She's being generous with us, as her daughter is kind of the only responsible individual from the family - we have worked to make things work while her family went through many hardships; while we haven't been financially responsible for them, we have been financially independent from our parents since 17. It's been hard.
She is gifting us 25k in a few months when her ""reward"" comes in, the suit has been a long time working apparently. She intends to buy property. We are her beneficiaries on everything. 
I wish I could say we were taking over her finances for this point, as she's growing in age and I wish to ensure a comfortable life for her. I am afraid of her being financially abused following this settlement. 

My wife and I would like to buy a home, we live in the SE Wisconsin area. We are however, painfully aware that money doesn't come with this kind of ease. This to us is like a gift from God.
 We're looking to see if anyone has any particular information about what this will entail for us, and what the ""best"" move would be. Investment, property, or something else? 

I'm looking to everyone we know for information, and seeking additional advice from you guys.

Thank you.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/1nn77d9/mil_has_won_a_large_settlement_as_a_result_we_are/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/1nn77d9/mil_has_won_a_large_settlement_as_a_result_we_are/,

Looking for any advice on how to manage building a financial safety net/start paying down my debt. I’ve been paying $500/month on my credit card (about double the minimum) but it still hasn’t made much of a dent and leaves me with pretty much no money after my typical expenses. 

Fortunately, I have a 401K through work and have about $10k in there, but my checking/savings is essentially zero (living 100% paycheck to paycheck).

My expenses are quite high— rent is $1585/month, utilities around $300. I make approximately $3,594 a month after taxes. I’ve been using a budget sheet and that’s helped me get better control of unnecessary spending but still feels like an impossible battle.

I know I should probably pick up extra work but I’m already working a full-time job and have had a hard time finding flexible part-time work. I would prefer something remote that I can fit in whenever I have time, but most of those options seem like total scams.


Truly any advice is helpful!! Feeling extremely stressed and scared for my future…. 


*UPDATE*
First off, thank you to everyone who responded!! All of your advice has been very helpful and has given me some great direction for my next steps.

I wanted to share my thoughts on how I plan to tackle this and add a little more detail, per some questions asked in the comments.

#1: RENT- I live in NYC with a roommate. This is truly the cheapest option I've been able to find, within reasonable geographic limits needed for commuting to my job. 

#2: Credit Interest Rate- my card has a 29.99% APR. 

#3: Additional spending- I didn't initially list that I had a $200/month dental payment (just paid off this week!!!) and $150/month student loans.....can't even go there until the credit card is resolved. I work in nonprofit so I am hoping that Student Loan relief is still an option for me in the future (haven't hit the needed # of years yet)

My Plan Forward:
I think I am going to enroll in a Financial Relief Program through Amex (my credit card company) They have a 48 month program that offers a very reasonable monthly payment, which would GREATLY help my monthly budget. The downside will be that I cannot use Amex at all during the duration of the program, but given where I've gotten myself to with the card in the first place, that seems fair.

Does anyone have insights or advice on this program/whether this is a good plan? Reducing my monthly card payments will allow me to build a savings safety net while still chipping away at the credit debt.....it feels like a reasonable plan to me but I am very open to further input!

NW: 625k
No debt. 
Extremely stable jobs. Only plan on having one child maybe in 2-3 years.

Is it unwise to spend $15k (2.5%) of our NW to get a private pilot license? Additionally, I would probably have to pay around $600/month indefinitely to maintain my skills and knowledge. 

I don’t plan on ever flying for a living and I understand technically it is a “waste of money” but I love aviation and this is the best time right now where our income is pretty high and i have a ton of free time. 

15k didnt seem like much to me but viewing it from a percentage of my NW makes it a little more daunting. 

Despite being an insanely expensive hobby, is this a reasonable to consider?
