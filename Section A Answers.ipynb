    "### Insights from “Building Natural Language Processing tools for Runyakitara”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The project to build Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools for Runyakitara is not merely a technical endeavour but a profound act of cultural reclamation and resistance against historical and contemporary linguistic marginalization. The insights gleaned reveal a narrative where technology becomes a tool to redress the imbalances created by colonialism and globalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "A central insight is the enduring impact of colonial and missionary history on the current linguistic landscape. The article explains how the fragmentation of Runyakitara into four distinct languages (Runyankore, Rukiga, Runyoro, Rutooro) was crystallized by missionaries who used different orthographies for Bible translations. Furthermore, the promotion of Luganda and English during the colonial and post-colonial eras systematically disadvantaged Runyakitara, confining it to lower social status and informal domains. This historical context is crucial; it demonstrates that the language's \"low-resource\" status is not a natural state but the result of specific historical pressures that prioritized other languages for administration, education, and prestige.\n",
    "\n",
    "In response, the development of NLP tools like RunyaSpeller and LearnRunya is framed as a modern form of revitalization that directly counters these historical trends. By creating a standardized spellchecker, the project imposes a digital order and correctness on the language, pushing back against the orthographic inconsistencies born from its fragmented history. More importantly, by associating Runyakitara with digital technology through language learning apps and computational analysis, the project actively works to enhance its cultural prestige. In a world where technological relevance often equates to modernity and utility, this effort seeks to reposition Runyakitara from a \"vernacular\" language to one capable of functioning in the digital age.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the article insightfully positions the \"mother tongue\" education policy in Uganda, which is hampered by a lack of materials, as a continuation of the same systemic issue. The Runya Corpus and the CALL systems are designed to fill this very gap, creating the educational resources that the state has been unable to provide. Thus, the project becomes a grassroots, academic intervention to realize a policy goal, using technology to ensure that the language can be taught, learned, and used accurately by future generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the deepest insight from this project is that computational linguistics can be a powerful agent of cultural empowerment. By building NLP tools for Runyakitara, the researchers are not just processing words, they are interpreting history, using technology to mend the linguistic fractures of the past and to forge a sustainable, dignified future for the language and its people.\n",

    "### Recommendations to the ethnic leaders of the Runyakitara speakers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd recommend the ethnic leaders to consider the following actions to fully harness the power of these new language technologies for the Runyakitara community:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, **I'd recommend they lead a community-wide effort to build their digital library, the RunyaCorpus.** They should actively encourage their writers, journalists, and families to contribute texts from news articles and stories to personal letters. The strength of the spell-checker and learning apps depends entirely on the wealth of data their community can provide, and it's crucial that this foundation is built from within.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Furthermore, **I'd recommend they officially endorse and integrate tools like LearnRunya into both their schools and homes.** By advocating for its use in classrooms and promoting it to families, especially in urban areas, they can ensure their children have engaging ways to learn and practice Runyakitara, turning everyday devices into tools for cultural connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I'd also recommend they use the RunyaSpeller to **empower a new wave of content creators within their community.** They should encourage their bloggers, authors, and social media users to confidently produce modern content in Runyakitara. This will help their language thrive online and in contemporary life, moving it beyond traditional domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, and most importantly, **I'd recommend they invest in their future by fostering their own tech experts.** They should identify and support their youth to pursue studies in computational linguistics and software development. This ensures that the next generation of these tools is built and maintained by their own people, securing their linguistic sovereignty for the long term.\n",
